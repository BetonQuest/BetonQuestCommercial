## Contact information

- The best way to contact me is directly via **Discord**: `wolf2323gabriel`
- Alternatively, you can open an **issue** in this repository: [create issue](https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuestCommercial/issues/new)

## Payment Information

- **Bank transfer** is currently the preferred method for payments. All necessary details are included on the invoice.
- [**OpenCollective**](https://opencollective.com/betonquest) is an alternative way to pay for commissions,
  but not preferred, as it has one mayor drawback.
  OpenCollective, our so-called "fiscal host", takes a **10% fee** on all transactions.
  This means you need to pay `amount / 0.9` to cover the fee.
  It has also one advantage, you stay anonymous, because the invoice will be issued to OpenCollective and not to you.
  But this will also mean that you will not get an invoice at all.
  So basically you donate some money to the BetonQuest OpenCollective project and I get paid from there.
- **PayPal is currently not accepted** (as it would require a business PayPal account).
- If you prefer other payment methods, feel free to ask — I may consider adding more options in the future.

## Invoice Requirements

For legal reasons, invoices require:
- Your **real name**
- Your **physical address**
- Your **email address** (for sending the invoice)

## Commission Work

If you are interested in commissioning me for custom development, please read the following information carefully:

### Process

1. **Clarifying the Request**  
   Before starting, I will work with you to fully understand your request, and we will define a clear target for the commission.

2. **Estimation**  
   Once the target is agreed upon, I will estimate how many hours of work are needed.

3. **Pricing**  
   - My standard rate is **30 € per hour**.  
   - For commissions related to **BetonQuest** or **BetonQuestPlus**, I offer a **50% discount**, reducing the price to **15 € per hour**.

4. **Binding Invoice**  
   After the estimation, I will create a **binding invoice** based on the estimated hours. This means:  
   - The price is fixed based on the estimate.  
   - Any additional work required is my risk and responsibility.
   - **Prepayment:** Commissions are always prepaid.  
       - For invoices exceeding **150 €**, payment can be split into multiple installments.
